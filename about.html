       "I never thought that I would even be in the kitchen, let alone fall in love with baking. I was introduced to this amazing hobby by my best friend Monica ( who by the way is an amazing chef!). I can definitely say that I am no professional baker, but hoping that maybe in a couple years I can. Although there are many good desserts to choose from, my absolute favorite thing to bake would be chocolate chip muffins."

    <h3>Boat Sailing</h3>

        "I've learned how to sail a boat when I was younger by my father. 
        Nothing feels better than having the wind hit your face as you're on the water, if you're lucky you get to see some dolphins in the water passing by. Although I failed at teaching my friend Joey how to sail, it was nice to be on the boat again after some time."
